    <h1>FRAKO Power Factor Correction Capacitor</h1>
</div>
<div class="sub-head" id="sub-head1">
    <p>FRAKO Power Factor Correction Capacitors are globally recognized as some of the best power capacitors available, produced by FRAKO, a German company with over 80 years of experience in the industry. With a commitment to quality and innovation, FRAKO is ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certified, ensuring that their products meet the highest international standards. The company has established itself as a leader in power capacitor technology across various countries, known for its reliable, efficient, and durable solutions.

        Designed for a variety of applications, FRAKO Power Capacitors play a crucial role in improving the power factor in low-voltage (LV) networks. By optimizing power quality, these capacitors help businesses reduce energy costs and enhance system performance. Their advanced engineering allows them to perform effectively under various conditions, making them an essential component in modern electrical systems.</p>
        <h2><b>Application</b></h2>
            <p>FRAKO Power Capacitors are essential for improving the power factor in low-voltage (LV) networks. Given that power systems often have harmonic content due to non-linear loads, FRAKO Power Factor Correction Capacitors are designed to tackle this. For networks with low harmonic content, Heavy Duty Capacitors are ideal, while Super Heavy Duty Capacitors are recommended for high harmonic content. These capacitors can handle frequent switching and high 
                inrush currents, protecting against power quality issues such as voltage sags. Heavy Duty Capacitors suit fixed and standard Automatic Power Factor Correction Systems, while Super Heavy Duty Capacitors work well for Detuned and Tuned Filters.</p>

        <h2>Mechanical Construction and Design</h2>
        <p>The FRAKO Capacitors feature self-healing dielectric, using metallized polypropylene foil for maximum durability. In case of failure, the cover plate is designed as an overload valve to disconnect the capacitor from the mains safely. This ensures the capacitor is protected even under stress. FRAKO Capacitors come in three versions:
             Basic, Standard, and Premium, addressing different power system needs.</p>
